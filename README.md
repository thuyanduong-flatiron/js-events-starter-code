# Event Listeners
## Type of Events

## .addEventListener() on a DOM node
- takes in a string for the type of the event, and a callback function to be invoked when the event happens
- (optional) argument for the callback is the event itself

## When to add an event Listener
- on load of page?
- on creation of element?

## Practice
- When click of email -> alert("contacting <email> ")
- When submit the form -> add new instructor row


## Some events have default behavior
- event.preventDefault()
